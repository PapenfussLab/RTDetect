Description: RTDetect contains functions for detecting retrotransposed transcripts (RTs) from structural variant calls. 
It takes structural variant calls in GRanges of breakend notation and identifies RTs by exon-exon junctions and insertion sites. 
The candidate RTs are reported by events and annotated with information of the inserted transcripts.
